# Motivation
<ul>
<li>Getting the interface you want from the interfaces you have.</li>
</ul>

# Summary
<ul>
<li>A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.</li>
<li>Create a component which aggregates (has a reference to, ...) the adaptee.</li>
<li>Intermediate representations can pile up: use caching and other optimizations.</li>
</ul>
