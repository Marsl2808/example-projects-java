# Motivation
<ul>
<li>Treating individual (scalar) and aggregate objects uniformly. I.e. Foo & List<Foo> common API.</li>
</ul>

# Summary
<ul>
<li>Objects can use other objects via inheritance/composition.</li>
<li>Some composed and singular objects need similar behaviors.</li>
<li>Composite design pattern lets us treat both types of objects uniformly.</li>
<li>Java supports container iteration with the Iterable<T> interface.</li>
<li>A single object can masquerade as a collection by returning a single-element collection containing only this.</li>
</ul>
